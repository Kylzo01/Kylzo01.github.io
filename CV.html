      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>

      <!--Insert block of text that is my personal statement -->
      <p1>I am currently a student studying Computing Science at Robert Gordons University.
        I used to be a pupil at Inverurie Academy.
        <br><br> I feel I am committed. This is shown by the fact that I have been playing cello since I was seven years old.
        I also was in cubs and scouts for around 6 years until I was too old and had to leave. In my time in cubs and scouts I got the highest possible award in both groups. In cubs this was the "Silver Cub Scout Award" and in scouts it was the
        "Gold
        Scout Award".
        <br><br>I also went to many extra-curricular groups such as the school choir and the school orchestra in my time at Inverurie Academy.
        <br><br>I go to badminton training and am also volunteer at a beginnerâ€™s badminton group helping to teach the younger players. I also volunteered at a coding club held at the school that helps children in S1-3 learn to code. I did this when
        I was in S6.
        From around S3 to S6 i was a part of the "Rights Respecting School Group". This group promotes equality amongst pupils. This has helped me because it helps me be part of a group and shown me many ways to look at situations.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <!--THis block of text is my previous jobs and informatio about them -->
        <p1>In my life so far I have had 2 jobs. My first job was a paper round and my second (and current) job was at Morrisons</p1>
        <br><br>
        <p1>My paper round was a morning paper round and involved me getting up at 6 am so that I would have time to do my paper round and also have time to get ready for school. I had this paper round for around 3 years and I was reliable
          throughout
          this time. I never missed any days in my time with a paper round, the only days I missed was due to holidays.</p1>
        <br><br>
        <p1>As i said before, I currently work at Morisons in Inverurie. When I started I worked in the groceries department. This was generally doing what was needed around the store. Such as stacking shelves or tidying up the shelves. I was later
          then moved to the bakery department.
          In the bakery department I have to date check products and reduce products as and when needed, I need to ensure that I do this accurately so that I do not give the store a bad image</p1>
