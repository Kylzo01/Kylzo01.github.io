  <h1>My Projects</h1>

  <h3>Project 1 - Arduino Project</h3>

    <p4>Keep Talking and Nobody explodes <br> (which our game is inspired by)</p4>
  </div>

  <!--THis is a block of code about my arduino project that is being made for my RGU grade -->
  <p2>The first project I undertook was in a group as a part of my computing science course at RGU. For this project we had to use a arduino and some atatchments to create a device that is a product that would be useful for people. We decided to
    create a bomb disposal game. The game will have differenct modules that will be required to be completed so that the "bomb" does not explode.
    The game will be created using an arduino, a couple breadboards, wires, buzzers, buttons, led's and will be coded using Java and Processing.<br>
    Our game was inspired by the VR game "Keep talking and nobody explodes". This game is also a bomb disposal game where one player reads out instruction to another player who has to dismantle a bomb.</p2>

  <h3>Project 2 - My CV Website</h3>

  </div>

  <p2>My next project I was involved with was the creation of this website.This website took me a reasonable amount of time as before I started making it I was not well adversed in my knowledge in HTML. Of the hardests parts of the website was
    likely the CV Page. This is because I struggled to find a way to make the images disapear effectively on click.
    I feel my website could possibly have more colours involved but I aslo beleive that with the minimal bright colours the website looks more professional.</p2>
